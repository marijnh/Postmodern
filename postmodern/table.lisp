  (:documentation "At the heart of Postmodern's DAO system is the dao-class
metaclass. It allows you to define classes for your database-access objects as
regular CLOS classes. Some of the slots in these classes will refer to columns
in the database. To specify that a slot refers to a column, give it a :col-type
option containing an S-SQL type expression (useful if you want to be able to
derive a table definition from the class definition), or simply a :column
option with value T. Such slots can also take a :col-default option, used to
provide a database-side default value as an S-SQL expression. You can use the
:col-name initarg (whose unevaluated value will be passed to to-sql-name) to
specify the slot's column's name.

DAO class definitions support two extra class options: :table-name to give the
name of the table that the class refers to (defaults to the class name), and
:keys to provide a set of primary keys for the table. If more than one key is
provided, this creates a multi-column primary key and all keys must be
specified when using operations such as update-dao and get-dao. When no primary
keys are defined, operations such as update-dao and get-dao will not work.

IMPORTANT: Class finalization for a dao class instance are wrapped with a
thread lock. However, any time you are using threads and a class that
inherits from other classes, you should ensure that classes are finalized
before you start generating threads that create new instances of that class.

The (or db-null integer) form is used to indicate a column can have NULL values
otherwise the column will be treated as NOT NULL.

Simple example:

    (defclass users ()
      ((name :col-type string :initarg :name :accessor user-name)
       (creditcard :col-type (or db-null integer) :initarg :card :col-default :null)
       (score :col-type bigint :col-default 0 :accessor user-score))
      (:metaclass dao-class)
      (:keys name))

In this case the name of the users will be treated as the primary key and the
database table is assume to be users.

Now look at a slightly more complex example.

    (defclass country ()
      ((id :col-type integer :col-identity t :accessor id)
       (name :col-type text :col-unique t :initarg :country :accessor country)
       (region-id :col-type integer :col-references ((regions id)) :initarg :region-id
          :accessor region-id))
        (:metaclass dao-class)
      (:table-name countries))

In this example we have an id column which is specified to be an identity column.
Postgresql will automatically generate a sequence of of integers and this will
be the primary key.

We have a name column which is specified as unique and is not null.

We have a region-id column which references the id column in the regions table.
This is a foreign key constraint and Postgresql will not accept inserting a country
into the database unless there is an existing region with an id that matches this
number. Postgresql will also not allow deleting a region if there are countries
that reference that region's id. If we wanted Postgresql to delete countries when
regions are deleted, that column would be specified as:

   (region-id :col-type integer :col-references ((regions id) :cascade)
     :initarg :region-id :accessor region-id)

Now you can see why the double parens.

We also specify that the table name is not 'country' but 'countries'. (Some style guides
recommend that table names be plural and references to rows be singular.)

When inheriting from DAO classes, a subclass' set of columns also contains
all the columns of its superclasses. The primary key for such a class is the
union of its own keys and all the keys from its superclasses. Classes
inheriting from DAO classes should probably always use the dao-class metaclass
themselves.

When a DAO is created with make-instance, the :fetch-defaults keyword argument
can be passed, which, when T, will cause a query to fetch the default values
for all slots that refers to columns with defaults and were not bound through
initargs. In some cases, such as serial columns, which have an implicit default,
this will not work. You can work around this by creating your own sequence,
e.g. 'my_sequence', and defining a (:nextval \"my_sequence\") default.

Finally, DAO class slots can have an option :ghost t to specify them as ghost
slots. These are selected when retrieving instances, but not written when
updating or inserting, or even included in the table definition. The only known
use for this to date is for creating the table with (oids=true), and specify a
slot like this:

    (oid :col-type integer :ghost t :accessor get-oid)"))

(defgeneric dao-keys (class)
  (:documentation "Returns list of slot names that are the primary key of DAO
class. Explicit keys takes priority over col-identity which takes priority
over col-primary-key.

This is likely interesting if you have primary keys which are composed of
more than one slot. Pay careful attention to situations where the primary key
not only has more than one column, but they are actually in a different order
than they are in the database table itself. Obviously the table needs to have
been defined. You can provide a quoted class-name or an instance of a dao."))

method that doesn't involve a database exception. This is safe to use both in

transaction to prevent a race condition. The way it works is:

If the object contains unbound slots, we call insert-dao directly, thus the
behavior is like save-dao.

Otherwise we try to update a record with the same primary key. If the
PostgreSQL returns a non-zero number of rows updated it treated as the
record is already exists in the database, and we stop here.

If the PostgreSQL returns a zero number of rows updated, it treated as the
record does not exist and we call insert-dao.

The race condition might occur at step 3 if there's no transaction: if UPDATE
returns zero number of rows updated and another thread inserts the record at
that moment, the insertion implied by step 3 will fail.

Note, that triggers and rules may affect the number of inserted or updated
rows returned by PostgreSQL, so zero or non-zero number of affected rows may
not actually indicate the existence of record in the database.

This method returns two values: the DAO object and a boolean (T if the object
was inserted, NIL if it was updated).

IMPORTANT: This is not the same as insert on conflict (sometimes called an upsert)
in Postgresq. An upsert in Postgresql terms is an insert with a fallback of updating
the row if the insert key conflicts with an already existing row. An upsert-dao
in Postmodern terms is the reverse. First you try updating an existing object. If
there is no existing object to oupdate, then you insert a new object."))

column names (strings or symbols) and writers, where writers are either
symbols referring to a slot in the objects, or functions taking two arguments ―
an instance and a value ― which can be used to somehow store the value in the
new instance. When any DAO-fetching function is called in the body, and
columns matching the given names are encountered in the result, the writers
are used instead of the default behaviour (try and store the value in the slot
that matches the column name).

An example of using this is to add some non-column slots to a DAO class, and
use query-dao within a with-column-writers form to pull in extra information
about the objects, and immediately store it in the new instances."
